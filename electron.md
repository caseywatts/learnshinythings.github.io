  [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) is a framework you can use to make desktop applications using JavaScript. You may have already used an Electron app - the Slack desktop app and the text editor Atom are examples.

  In this one-day workshop, you'll produce your own fully-functioning Electron app from scratch. You'll learn about modern javascript (ES2017), Node.js, browser Javascript, and the Electron APIs.

### Prerequisites?

Required: basic programming experience in JavaScript. Variables, functions, loops, JSON.

Node experience is NOT required. If you want to play with Node ahead of time anyway (or brush up on your Javascript), We'd recommend NodeSchool's two command-line courses: [Javascripting](https://github.com/workshopper/javascripting) and [LearnYouNode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode). If you'd enjoy reading/skimming a book, we might recommend [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (free to read online).


### What will I learn?
Electron provides a set of [cross-platform APIs](https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos) you can use to interact with the desktop computer. You can use these to have an icon in the tray/menubar, to display notifications, register keyboard shortcuts, and much more. An Electron application has a node “server” running locally doing most of the work, and often additionally a browser process running locally to display things prettily.

This class will also teach and reinforce [ES2017 fundamentals](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features), potentially including:
  - arrow function
  - classes
  - enhanced object literal
  - template strings
  - destructuring
  - modules
  - let vs. const
  - default parameters
  - rest parameters
  - spread operator
  - promises
  - async/await


### Is Electron good enough to actually use?

Yep!

Seems too good to be true? Apps built with Electron include: Slack, Atom, VSCode, Franz, Twitch, Discord, Github Desktop, and [more](https://electron.atom.io/apps/).

The biggest concern people have about using Electron is the possibility that the end product might be more resource-intensive than a native app. In our research, an electron menubar app uses RAM and CPU comparable to other menubar apps.

Casey's electron app `electron-ping` uses this amount of CPU and RAM to run:
- 0.9% CPU, 70.6 MB of RAM

Spot-checks of some other menubar apps running in the background on the same computed:
- Dropbox 0.3% CPU, 165MB
- Screenhero 0.2% CPU, 124MB
- Google Drive 0.3% CPU, 151MB

### Scenario / User Story
You work remotely. When pair programming or video chatting online, sometimes the connection gets bad.
You're never sure if it's your side or their side having issues.
Sometimes you smartly have a terminal open and have `ping google.com` running - then you can tell whether your connection is good!
You'd love it if:

1. You could tell at a glance (without an additional terminal window) whether your ping is currently good or bad
2. You could get a notification when your wifi goes out, or comes back


### Our Project
In this workshop, you will create from start to finish a tray icon that will display whether or not you are currently connected to the internet. A node process inside of the Electron app will `ping google.com every second. We will then:

1. Use the tray api to change the app’s icon to reflect the current state
2. Display a notification when the internet appears to go up or down

You can see two example applications like this, here:

- [https://github.com/groeneveld/am-i-connected](https://github.com/groeneveld/am-i-connected)
- [https://github.com/caseywatts/electron-ping](https://github.com/caseywatts/electron-ping)

And an unrelated application that Casey wrote:

- [https://github.com/caseywatts/heroku-ci-menubar](https://github.com/caseywatts/heroku-ci-menubar)
